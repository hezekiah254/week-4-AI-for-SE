AI in Software Engineering Project
📘 Overview

This project explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) enhances software engineering through code generation, automated testing, and machine learning-based prediction.
It includes three key tasks using AI-driven tools such as GitHub Copilot, Selenium IDE with AI plugins, and a machine learning model for breast cancer prediction.
Theoretical questions related to AI bias, learning models, and AI ethics are also addressed.

🚀 Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion
Tool: GitHub Copilot / Tabnine
Objective:

To create a Python function that sorts a list of dictionaries by a specific key using AI-assisted code completion and compare it with a manual implementation.

Findings:

The AI-generated code was more efficient, readable, and accurate.

It reduced the time required to write, debug, and optimize code.

The manual approach required more effort and was less efficient.

Conclusion:

AI-assisted coding tools significantly improve developer productivity by automating repetitive tasks and suggesting optimized solutions.
However, human review remains essential to ensure correctness and maintain coding standards.

🤖 Task 2: AI-Powered Test Automation
Framework: Selenium IDE with AI Plugins / Testim.io
Objective:

To automate login functionality testing for valid and invalid credentials using AI-enhanced test automation tools.

Results Summary:

Both valid and invalid test cases executed successfully.

AI-based tools adapted to minor UI changes automatically using self-healing locators.

The overall success rate of automated tests was 100%.

Conclusion:

AI improves test coverage and reduces manual maintenance effort.
By learning from previous test runs, it detects more edge cases and ensures greater reliability and efficiency compared to traditional manual testing.

🩺 Task 3: Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning
Tool: Scikit-learn / TensorFlow (AI Model)
Objective:

To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on patient data such as cell size, texture, and smoothness.

Approach:

The model was trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

Various algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) were compared.

Data was preprocessed for missing values and normalized for accuracy.

The dataset was split into training and testing sets (typically 80/20).
